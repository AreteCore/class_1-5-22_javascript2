// Chessboard

// Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, 
// using newline characters to separate lines. 
// ? newline character: \n
// At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. 
// The characters should form a chessboard.

// Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

//  # # # #
// # # # # 
//  # # # #
// # # # # 
//  # # # #
// # # # # 
//  # # # #
// # # # #

// When you have a program that generates this pattern, 
// define a binding size = 8 and change the program so 
// that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the 
// given width and height.

// ? I presume that there will be only one parameter, though it's easy enough to set it up for two params (H x W)

// ! This is version 2 of the program
// ? see below for the original and some brainstorming notes

//there has to be an easier way to do this...
//i want to do it with one long string of x+o+x+o+x+o+x+o

// lets see ... how about 9. if 
// xox
// oxo
// xox

// what if you add extras for counting for the newlines... can you do it?
// add 3 so 3*4 is the math
// xoxoxoxoxoxo
// xoxBxoxBxoxB
// doesnt work for patterning tho
// xoxB
// xoxB
// xoxB

// it has the wrong pattern with an odd number
// lets see if it works with evens and still keeps the pattern

// heres 4, a grid of 16, so 4*5 is our target with the newlines included
// xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo

// xoxoB
// oxoxB
// xoxoB
// oxoxB

// so with even numbered dimensions, you can take dim and do dim * (dim+1)
// and just use a newline at every modulo of dim+1
// the pattern will be chessBoard

// but if you modulo with dim*(dim+1) and dim is ODD, the pattern is vertically symmetrical
// so youd have to have a separate loop for the odd ones anyway, to make sure the pattern alternated line to line
// hmm


// function alternate(a,b) {
//     console.log(a + b + a + b + a + b + "\n" + a + b + a + b)
// }

// alternate("f","g")
